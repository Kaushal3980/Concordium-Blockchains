In this code, I've created separate modules for the CIS2 Multi and CIS2 Market contracts. 
The main code file contains the implementation of the mint_nft and buy_nft functions, the check_conditions function and the NFT struct.
At the end of the code, I've added the entry points for the CIS2 Multi and CIS2 Market contracts using the no_mangle attribute. 
These entry points will be used by the Concordium compiler to generate the appropriate contract files.
Make sure to replace the unimplemented!() placeholder implementations in the cis2_multi_contract and cis2_market_contract functions with 
the actual logic for the respective CIS2 contracts.
Once you've added the CIS2 contracts and the main code file, you can run the following command to build the contracts:

cargo concordium build --out module.wasm --schema-out schema.bin

This command will compile the code and generate the module.wasm and schema.bin files, which can be deployed to the Concordium blockchain.
